-- | A 'PreparedSource' has two operations on it: pull some data, and close the
-- 'PreparedSource'. Since 'PreparedSource' is built on top of 'ResourceT', all
-- acquired resources should be automatically released anyway. Closing a
-- 'PreparedSource' early
-- is merely an optimization to free scarce resources as soon as possible.
--
-- A 'PreparedSource' has three invariants:
--
-- * It is illegal to call 'sourcePull' after a previous call returns 'Closed', or after a call to 'sourceClose'.
--
-- * It is illegal to call 'sourceClose' multiple times, or after a previous
-- 'sourcePull' returns a 'Closed'.
--
-- * A 'PreparedSource' is responsible to free any resources when either 'sourceClose'
-- is called or a 'Closed' is returned. However, based on the usage of
-- 'ResourceT', this is simply an optimization.

-- | All but the simplest of 'PreparedSource's (e.g., @repeat@) require some
-- type of state to track their current status. This may be in the form of a
-- mutable variable (e.g., @IORef@), or via opening a resource like a @Handle@.
-- While a 'PreparedSource' is given no opportunity to acquire such resources,
-- this type is.
--
-- A 'Source' is simply a monadic action that returns a 'PreparedSource'. One
-- nice consequence of this is the possibility of creating an efficient
-- 'Monoid' instance, which will only acquire one resource at a time, instead
-- of bulk acquiring all resources at the beginning of running the 'Source'.
--
-- Note that each time you \"call\" a @Source@, it is started from scratch. If
-- you want a resumable source (e.g., one which can be passed to multiple
-- @Sink@s), you likely want to use a 'BufferedSource'.

-- | When actually interacting with 'Source's, we usually want to be able to
-- buffer the output, in case any intermediate steps return leftover data. A
-- 'BufferedSource' allows for such buffering, via the 'bsourceUnpull' function.
--
-- A 'BufferedSource', unlike a 'Source', is resumable, meaning it can be passed to
-- multiple 'Sink's without restarting.
--
-- Finally, a 'BufferedSource' relaxes one of the invariants of a 'Source': calling
-- 'bsourcePull' after an 'EOF' will simply return another 'EOF'.
--
-- A @BufferedSource@ is also known as a /resumable source/, in that it can be
-- called multiple times, and each time will provide new data. One caveat:
-- while the types will allow you to use the buffered source in multiple
-- threads, there is no guarantee that all @BufferedSource@s will handle this
-- correctly.

-- | Note that this instance hides the 'bsourceClose' record, so that a
-- @BufferedSource@ remains resumable. The correct way to handle closing of a
-- resumable source would be to call @bsourceClose@ on the originally
-- @BufferedSource@, e.g.:
--
-- > bsrc <- bufferSource $ sourceFile "myfile.txt"
-- > bsrc $$ drop 5
-- > rest <- bsrc $$ consume
-- > bsourceClose bsrc
--
-- Note that the call to the @$$@ operator allocates a /new/ 'BufferedSource'
-- internally, so that when @$$@ calls @bsourceClose@ the first time, it does
-- not close the actual file, thereby allowing us to pass the same @bsrc@ to
-- the @consume@ function. Afterwards, we should call @bsourceClose@ manually
-- (though @runResourceT@ will handle it for us eventually).
