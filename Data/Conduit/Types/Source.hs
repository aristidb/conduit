-- | A 'Source' has two operations on it: pull some data, and close the
-- 'Source'. Since 'Source' is built on top of 'ResourceT', all acquired
-- resources should be automatically released anyway. Closing a 'Source' early
-- is merely an optimization to free scarce resources as soon as possible.
--
-- A 'Source' has three invariants:
--
-- * It is illegal to call 'sourcePull' after a previous call returns 'Closed', or after a call to 'sourceClose'.
--
-- * It is illegal to call 'sourceClose' multiple times, or after a previous
-- 'sourcePull' returns a 'Closed'.
--
-- * A 'Source' is responsible to free any resources when either 'sourceClose'
-- is called or a 'Closed' is returned. However, based on the usage of
-- 'ResourceT', this is simply an optimization.

-- | All but the simplest of 'Source's (e.g., @repeat@ and @cycle@) require
-- some type of state to track their current status. This may be in the form of
-- a mutable variable (e.g., @IORef@), or via opening a resource like a
-- @Handle@. While a 'Source' is given no opportunity to acquire such
-- resources, this type is.
--
-- A 'Source' is simply a monadic action that returns a 'Source'. One nice
-- consequence of this is the possibility of creating an efficient 'Monoid'
-- instance, which will only acquire one resource at a time, instead of bulk
-- acquiring all resources at the beginning of running the 'Source'.
--
-- Note that each time you \"call\" a @Source@, it is started from scratch. If
-- you want a resumable source (e.g., one which can be passed to multiple
-- @Sink@s), you likely want to use a 'BufferedSource'.
